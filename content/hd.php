<p>"During my practicum, I was able to put the skills I learned at CDI to use and gain valuable experience in the field that led to a position with my employer. I am currently working as a Support Analyst with the federal government. I have a very rewarding career doing what I love. I would absolutely recommend the program to anyone that wants a career in the IT field."<p>
