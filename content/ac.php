<p> Assisting alcohol and drug abuse clients towards a clean and sober life is a challenging, rewarding, and diverse career path. If you want to make a difference in the lives of people in your community, FU Addictions and Community Services Worker diploma program is for you.</p>
<p> FU instructors are industry professionals who introduce students to a wide range of subjects including assessment and treatment planning, writing, and file management. Since addictions and community service workers are required to interact with clients and healthcare professionals, such as social workers, they need a broad understanding of the healthcare and addictions care industry. In addition, students will learn about human psychology, addiction prevention and intervention, pharmacology, and other medical areas. Each student must put their knowledge to the test as part of a 300-hour (eight weeks) mandatory clinical placement. </p>
